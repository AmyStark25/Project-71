            <h5 class="text-success text-capiatlized">"Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the pitch so the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the pitch were golden poles with hoops on the end."
— The Quidditch Pitch</h5>
            <p class="text-muted text-left">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has its own Quidditch pitch where Quidditch teams can practise, hold try-outs and play matches against each other.

            <h5 class="text-success  text-capiatlized"> "It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting... The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight... Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars... It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heaven."
— Description of the Great Hall</h5>
            <p class="text-muted text-left">The Great Hall in the Hogwarts Castle is the main gathering area in the school, which is located off the Entrance Hall. It is a large hall where students and teachers dine and congregate. Three meals a day are hosted in this hall.
The Great Hall is the main place where students receive their meals and daily owl post. Certain special events, such as the Sorting ceremony, and the Hallowe'en Feast are held here.
The large hall has enough space to hold every student, as well as the main staff and guests. The Hall has tall walls that reached up to the ceiling, which was covered with floating candles and enchanted to look like the sky above.</p>

                <p>The Triwizard Tournament is a magical contest held between the three largest wizarding schools of Europe: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Durmstrang Institute, and Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, each school being represented by one champion. Selected champions compete in three tasks — traditionally judged by the Headmasters or Headmistresses of the competing schools — designed to test magical ability, intelligence, and courage. Champions competed for the honour and glory of winning the Tournament, for the Triwizard Cup, and a monetary prize. The first Tournament was held sometime around the late 13th century.</p>
